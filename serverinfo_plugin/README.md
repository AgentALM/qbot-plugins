# Installation
All you have to do is create a file in your "commands" folder, name it "serverinfo.js", then copy and paste the code from the serverinfo.js file in this folder.
# IMPORTANT
I have not tested this in a qbot enviroment, only with my own bot. If there is any bugs, please message me on discord (Coop#3058) with the issue.

Follow the normal installation process for qbot plugins. Only add the files that end with ".js" though. After doing so create a new role which will be the role to allow people to DM others. You will have to give this role to anyone who should be able to DM users with the command. The usage of this command is (prefix)dm <member> <message>. <member> has to be one word and can be the name of a user, their ID, or by pinging someone. If you find any issues with any of these commands, report them to Anonymous on the support server.
